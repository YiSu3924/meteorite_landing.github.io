### Motivation:

This project seeks to explore meteorite landing data to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of meteorite impacts on Earth. By analyzing this data, we aim to answer questions about where meteorites tend to land, their mass distributions, and possible patterns in landing locations over time. This project is driven by a fascination with planetary science and geology, especially the ways meteorite impacts can reveal clues about space debris, the makeup of other celestial bodies, and Earth’s own geological story. Through this analysis, we are hoping to add something valuable to the ongoing exploration of these big questions.

### Related work:

Our interest in this project was sparked by recent celestial events, particularly the close approach of the Atlas Comet observed from Purple Mountain Observatory and the appearance of a unique phenomenon where the sky seemed to host ‘two moons.’ The Atlas Comet’s approach offered a vivid reminder of how nearby cosmic bodies are to Earth, inspiring a sense of curiosity about these rare events. Similarly, witnessing the ‘two moons’ effect underscored the awe and fascination that such occurrences bring. This project seeks to explore the sites of meteorite landings worldwide, with the hope of uncovering patterns and insights into how these extraterrestrial fragments reach and impact Earth, ultimately connecting us more closely with the universe’s diversity.

### Initial questions: 

How are meteorites distributed across the world all years from 1970-2013?

What is the number of meteorite landings changed through years by continents?
Is a statistically significant difference in mean meteorite mass across continents?
What are the anticipated geographical locations where meteorites are likely to land?


### Data:

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. As the data was provided as a CSV file, no additional scraping was necessary. We convert column names to lowercase, filter for records between the years 1970 and 2013, drop the "fall" column (since all entries have the same value), and filter out rows where latitude or longitude data is missing. We derived a continent column by classifying data according to the geo_location attribute.

### Exploratory analysis: 

Firstly, we generated an interactive map showing meteorite landings by continent from 1970 to 2013. It assigns unique colors to continents, subsets data for each, and plots markers with hover details (name, year, mass, and continent) using Plotly. Styled with an "open-street-map" background and a global view, the map provides a clear visualization of meteorite landing patterns. 

Secondly, we created a line plot showing the number of meteorite landings over time, categorized by continent. The data is grouped by year and continent, with the count of landings calculated for each group. Using Plotly, a scatter plot in line mode is created, with different colors representing continents. This visualization highlights temporal trends in meteorite landings across different continents.

Thirdly, we conducted an analysis using Welch’s ANOVA to examine differences in meteorite mass across continents, accounting for unequal variances. With a significance level of 0.05, the results (F = 9.2968, p-value 2.062×10−112.062 \times 10^{-11}) led us to reject the null hypothesis, indicating significant differences in mean mass among continents. Additionally, we created a summary table combining meteorite landing counts with continent areas to calculate landings per square kilometer, providing more spatial insights in a well-organized format.

Lastly, we predicted potential meteorite landing locations using clustering and random sampling techniques. First, k-means clustering is applied to meteorite data (reclat and reclong) with 500 centers to identify representative clusters of landing sites. Cluster centers are extracted, and random points are generated around these centers using normal distributions to simulate 5,000 potential landing locations. An interactive Plotly map visualizes the predicted locations as markers. 

### Discussion: 

The interactive map reveals an uneven global distribution of meteorite landings, with dense clusters in well-populated and extensively researched regions like Europe, North America, and parts of Asia. In contrast, regions such as Africa and Antarctica, as well as oceanic areas, show fewer recorded landings, likely due to observational and accessibility challenges. The Southern Hemisphere, particularly South America and Oceania, also has fewer data points compared to the Northern Hemisphere. These patterns highlight the influence of observational bias and the need for improved data collection in underrepresented regions to better understand global meteorite distribution.

The line plot shows significant variation in meteorite landings across continents. Antarctica leads with sharp peaks, which reflects focused research and preservation conditions, while oceans have minimal activity due to detection challenges. Africa, Asia, and Europe show steady but low counts, with North America showing moderate fluctuations. Oceania and South America have sparse data, likely due to fewer expeditions. The temporal spikes indicate periods of increased research efforts or significant meteorite events, emphasizing the influence of geography and observational factors on recorded landings.

The ANOVA test produced a p-value below 0.05, which leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating significant differences in mean meteorite masses across continents. This suggests that meteorite masses may vary by continent, potentially due to differences in geographic conditions, observation efforts, or preservation environments.

The prediction map shows potential meteorite landing clusters across all continents, with higher concentrations in Antarctica, Mediterranean, and North Africa. This map offers insights into landing patterns influenced by natural distribution and observational factors.
